1. Organize Your Project Structure
2. Write the setup.py Script
	i. setup.py is where you define your packageâ€™s metadata and dependencies.
3. Include Additional Metadata
	i. README.md: A Markdown file with a description of your package.
	ii. LICENSE: A file specifying the license under which your package is released.
4. Build Your Package
	python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
	This command creates:
	i. A source distribution (sdist).
	ii. A built distribution (a wheel file, bdist_wheel).
5. Testing the Package Locally
	Before distributing, you might want to install and test the package locally:
	pip install .
	This installs the package from the current directory.
6. Distribute Your Package
You can distribute the package by uploading it to PyPI. You'll need tools like twine
	twine upload dist/*
	Ensure you have an account on PyPI.
7. Continuous Integration
Optionally, you can automate building and distributing with CI/CD tools
like GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.
